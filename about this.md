title: About This
---

It's basically a public facing selection of stuff from a digital second brain or zettelkasten. It's explained in more depth [here](https://kevanchristmas.github.io/2024/02/02/7a2-whats-it-for/).

Tags are at the bottom of each post.

I see it as an exercise in sharing my personal route to something richer and more fulfilling. It is also intended as an open record of the things I am trying to teach myself; a declaration of the principles and beliefs I embrace.

There's also a section called [sandbox](https://kevanchristmas.github.io/sandbox/) where I put stuff that doesn't make it into the main feed even if it mentions it.
